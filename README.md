# lyft_sample
Sample code for Lyft Application:

"If you don’t have a current code sample you can share, please write a small web application in one of the above languages (Python/Ruby/Javascript). The application only needs to do the following:
Accept a POST request to the route “/test”, which accepts one argument “string_to_cut”
Return a JSON object with the key “return_string” and a string containing every third letter from the original string
(e.g.) If you POST {"string_to_cut": "iamyourlyftdriver"}, it will return: {"return_string": "muydv"}."

lyft_sample.py is sample code written in Python 3.

This code is in application for the Lyft Software Engineering Apprenticeship (2022).
